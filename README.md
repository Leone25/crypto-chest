# Crypto Chest

A secure, personal and self-hosted cloud drive for your files.

## Features
- **Secure**: All files are encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud.
- **Safe**: The server never knows your password, so no one other than you can access your files.
- **Self-hosted**: You can host it on your own server, so you have full control over your data.
